# Vibe Coding

This folder contains my coding experiments for creative and interactive web projects.


## Experiment 1: Greeting Clock
The first experiment is an interactive greeting clock HTML file that shows a dynamic greeting and background based on the time and timezone.

The final HTML file has been moved to the top-level `docs` folder for GitHub Pages hosting.

ðŸ‘‰ **View the live HTML file here:**
- [docs/greeting-clock.html](../docs/greeting-clock.html)

ðŸ‘‰ **Or open it directly in your browser via GitHub Pages:**
- https://thakurajayL.github.io/ai-experiments/docs/greeting-clock.html

You can open the above file in your browser or visit the GitHub Pages site if enabled.

More experiments will be added to this folder in the future!
