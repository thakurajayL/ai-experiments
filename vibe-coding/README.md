# Vibe Coding

This folder contains my coding experiments for creative and interactive web projects.



## Experiment 1: Greeting Clock
The first experiment is an interactive greeting clock HTML file that shows a dynamic greeting and background based on the time and timezone.

**Specification used to generate this clock:**

**Specification:**

- Show a screen with a greeting message: "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening" depending on the time.
- Display a small digital clock and a timezone dropdown next to each other, center aligned.
- If someone changes the timezone, update the greeting and clock based on the selected timezone.
- The background image should change depending on the time of day:
	- Morning: sun/landscape (with birds)
	- Afternoon: sun/sky
	- Evening: moon/stars
- Requirement: The AI should be able to generate jokes.
The final HTML file has been moved to the top-level `docs` folder for GitHub Pages hosting.

ðŸ‘‰ **View the live HTML file here:**
- [docs/greeting-clock.html](../docs/greeting-clock.html)

ðŸ‘‰ **Or open it directly in your browser via GitHub Pages:**

You can open the above file in your browser or visit the GitHub Pages site if enabled.

More experiments will be added to this folder in the future!
